    <h2>Grade Breakdown</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Assignment #1: 17%</li>
    <li>Assignment #2: 17%</li>
    <li>Assignment #3: 17%</li>
    <li>Midterm: 17%</li>
    <li>Final Project: 32% (milestone: 2%, poster presentation: 5%, paper: 25%)</li>

  <h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>
  <h4>For Assignments:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
    Study groups are allowed but we expect students to understand and complete their own assignments and to hand in one assignment per student.
    </li>
    <li>
    If you worked in a group, please put the names of your study group on your assignment on top.
    </li>
    <li>
    We also expect students to not look at implementations online. Just like all other classes at Stanford, we take the student <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/academics/masters-handbook/honor-code">Honor Code</a> seriously.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>For the Final Project:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Teams of up to three people are allowed. Larger teams are expected to do larger projects.</li>
    <li>Ordinarily, all team members will receive the same grade for an assignment - though we reserve the right, in case of egregiously unequal contributions, to assign different grades to different team members. You can contact us in confidence in the event of unequal collaborations</li>
    <li>You may use external libraries, etc. for the final project, but you must acknowledge all such usages.</li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Please ask if you have any questions about the collaboration policy.</strong></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="container sec">
    <h2>Late Policy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can use 6 late days, with up to 3 late days per assignment. A late day extends the deadline 24 hours. </li>
      <li>We have made an exception for assignment 3, for which you can use up to 4 late days.</li>
      <li>You can use (up to 3) late days for the final project as well. Groups use up one late day <em>per person</em> to extend the deadline a day. For example, a group of three people must have at least six remaining late days between them (distributed among them in any way) to extend the deadline two days.</li>
      <li>Once you have used all 6 late days, the penalty is 10% for each additional late day.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="sechighlight">
<div class="container sec">
    <h2>Regrading Requests</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you feel you deserved a better grade on an assignment, you may submit a regrade request on Gradescope within 3 days after the grades are released.
            Your request should briefly summarize why you feel the original grade was unfair.
            Your TA will reevaluate your assignment as soon as possible, and then issue a decision.
            If you are still not happy, you can ask for your assignment to be regraded by an instructor.
        </li>
        <li>Note that while doing a regrade  we may review your entire assigment, not just the part you bring to our attention (i.e., we may find errors in your work that we missed before).</li>
    </ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="container sec">
    <h2>Students with Documented Disabilities</h2>
    Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is being made. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (650-723-1066, <a href="http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/oae">http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/oae</a>).

<div class="container sec">
    <h2>Credit/No credit enrollment</h2>
    If you're doing the class credit/no credit then there are no special changes to the workload versus people registered for a grade. You are graded on work as usual, per standard Stanford rules. The only difference is that providing you reach a C- standard in your work, it will simply be graded as CR.  (So maybe you can take it a little bit easier.)
