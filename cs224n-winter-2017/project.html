  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The Course Project is worth a significant portion of your grade. It offers you the chance to apply your newly acquired skills towards an in-depth application.  </p>

  <p>Your project can be on any topic of your choice related to deep learning for NLP. To be precise: That means that the project should make substantive use of deep learning and substative use of human language data. You also have the option of doing a default final project (aka Assignment 4) that we will provide scaffolding code for. This will be similar to the other assignments but longer and more open-ended.</p>

    <!-- Conferences -->
    <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i-3HwziSVPem-hgJ1BW7MueLIxeDjUyO9fb5_lr3WDQ/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a> is a list of project ideas from Stanford researchers!</p>

    <p>To inspire more ideas, you might look at recent deep learning publications from top-tier NLP conferences and labs:</p>

  <h2>Important Dates</h2>
  Course project proposal (only for students not doing the default final project): due February 9.<br>
  The poster session will be held 12:15-3:15pm on March 21.<br>
  Final course project: due <b>March 17</b> (11:59pm). <br><br>

  <h2><a name="mentor">Finding a Mentor</a></h2>
  Students proposing their own project are <b>required</b> to have a mentor who will provide high-level guidance for the project. You must find a mentor before submitting your project proposal. To find a mentor
  <ol>
    <li>Contact them in office hours or through email. Briefly go over your background, interests, and ideas you have for the project.</li>
    <li>If they agree to mentor you, <b>email cs224n.win1617.mentors@gmail.com with your mentor cc'd</b>. In the email state who your mentor is as well as the names and SUNetIDs of the people in your team.</li>
  </ol>
   Here are the mentors affiliated with cs224n:
   <ul>
    <li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/">Chris Manning</a> (<img src="./images/manning@cs.stanford.edu.png">)</li>
    <li><a href="http://socher.org">Richard Socher</a> (<img src="./images/richard@socher.org.png">)</li>
    <li><a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/~danqi/">Danqi Chen</a> (<img src="./images/danqi@cs.stanford.edu.png">)</li>
    <li><a href="http://arun.chagantys.org">Arun Chaganty</a> (<img src="./images/chaganty@cs.stanford.edu.png">)</li>
    <li><a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/~kevclark/">Kevin Clark</a> (<img src="./images/kevclark@cs.stanford.edu.png">)</li>
    <li><a href="http://stanford.edu/~cases/">Ignacio Cases</a> (<img src="./images/cases@stanford.edu.png">)</li>
   </ul>
   However, you are free to ask anyone else (such as other Stanford faculty and grad students) to mentor you as long as they have substantial experience with deep learning.
   <br><br>
   Mentors will take up to 25 teams each on a first-come-first-serve basis, so it is recommended you contact them early!

  <h2>Grading Policy</h2>
  The final project is worth 30% for your grade (with your poster presentation comprising additional 2%).
  You are allowed to work in groups of up to 3 people and may use up to 3 late days.
  See the <a href="grading.html">grading page</a> for more details.<br><br>

  <a name="proposal"></a><h2>Project Proposal</h2>
  The project proposal should be a few short paragraphs (200-400 words overall). If you are doing the default final project, you do not need to submit a proposal. <b>If you do not submit a proposal on time, you have to do the default final project</b>. Your proposal should contain the following headings:
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <b>Mentor:</b> Who is your mentor for the project? You should have already emailed cs224n.win1617.mentors@gmail.com with this information.

  </ul>

  <a name="poster"></a><h2>Poster Session</h2>
  We will hold a poster session in which you will present the results of your projects im the form of a poster. The poster session will happen on Match 21st, 12:15-3:15pm (location: Lathrop second floor). Poster boards and easels will be provided.

  <h2>Example Project Reports</h2>
  Your project reports should structure like a NLP conference paper (NIPS, ICML, EMNLP, ACL, etc.). You can find publications from Stanford NLP Group from <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/publications.shtml">here</a>. In addition, you may also take a look at some previous projects from other Stanford CS classes, such as <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs221/sample-projects/">CS221</a>, <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/projects2013.html">CS229</a>, <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/projects.html">CS224W</a> and <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/projects.html">CS231n</a> as well as previous <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/cs224n/">cs224n</a> and <a href="http://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports_2016.html">cs224d</a> projects.

  <h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>
  You can work in teams of up to <strong>3</strong> people. Larger teams are expected to do larger projects. See the <a href="grading.html">grading page</a> for more details.

  <h2>Honor Code</h2>
  You may use any existing code, libraries, etc. and consult and any papers, books, online references, etc. for your project. However, you must cite your sources in your writeup and clearly indicate which parts of the project are your contribution and which parts were implemented by others. Under no circumstances may you look at another cs224n group’s code or incorporate their code into your project.

  <br><br>
  If you are doing a similar project for another class, you must make this clear and write down the exact portion of the project that is being counted for CS224n.
